# Task Model Implementation - Step 2

## Overview
Implementation of the `Task` model to support core functionality for todo tasks including creation, update, assignment, and deletion.

## Model Definition
The `Task` model is defined in `src/tasks/models.py` and contains the following fields:
- `title`: Character field (max length 200) for the task title
- `description`: Text field for detailed task description 
- `assigned_to`: Character field (max length 100) indicating the assigned user

## Migrations
After defining the model, migrations were generated using `python manage.py makemigrations tasks` and successfully applied with `python manage.py migrate`. This creates the corresponding database schema to store tasks.
