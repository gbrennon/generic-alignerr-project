# TASK 1: Create Python Django Project

## Summary
Cleaned up docker configurations and prepared the project for Python/Django development.

## Approach
1. Reviewed documentation in `docs/` directory
2. Removed unnecessary docker files for other languages (Java, TypeScript) to keep only Python-related configurations
3. Prepared to create Python project using Poetry and Docker

## Challenges
- Ensuring correct file permissions for docker files
- Verifying docker-compose-python.yml still functions after cleanup
