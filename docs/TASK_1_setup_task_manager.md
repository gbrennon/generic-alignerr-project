# TASK 1: Setup Task Manager Project

## Summary
Set up a TypeScript project for a task manager application using Express and SQLite.

## Approach
1. Cleaned up unnecessary Docker files as the application doesn't require Docker.
2. Initialized a new npm project.
3. Installed TypeScript and necessary dependencies (express, sqlite3) along with their type definitions.
4. Created `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.
5. Set up the basic Express server structure in `src/index.ts`.

## Challenges
- Ensured TypeScript compiler options were correctly set for a Node.js environment.
- Resolved TypeScript errors by installing appropriate type definitions (@types/express, @types/node, @types/sqlite3).

## Resources
- [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- [sqlite3 npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
