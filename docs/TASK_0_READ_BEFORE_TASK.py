3. After completing a task document what was done in a new markdown file inside the `docs` directory.
4. The name of the markdown file should follow the format: `TASK_<task_number>_<short_description>.md`.
5. The markdown file should include:
   - A brief summary of the task.
   - The approach taken to complete the task.
   - Any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
   - References to any resources or documentation used.
